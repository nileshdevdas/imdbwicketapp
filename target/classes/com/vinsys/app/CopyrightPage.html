<div class="container">Copyright is a form of protection provided
	by US law to authors of "original works of authorship". When a work is
	published under the authority of the copyright owner, a notice of
	copyright may be placed on all publicly distributed copies or
	phonorecords. The use of the notice is the responsibility of the
	copyright owner and does not require permission from, or registration
	with, the Copyright Office. Use of the notice informs the public that a
	work is protected by copyright, identifies the copyright owner, and
	shows the year of first publication. Furthermore, in the event that a
	work is infringed, if the work carries a proper notice, the court will
	not give any weight to a defendant's use of an innocent infringement
	defense—that is, to a claim that the defendant did not realize that the
	work was protected. An innocent infringement defense can result in a
	reduction in damages that the copyright owner would otherwise receive.

	US law no longer requires the use of a copyright notice, although
	placing it on a work does confer certain benefits to the copyright
	holder. Prior law did, however, require a notice, and the use of a
	notice is still relevant to the copyright status of older works. For
	works first published on or after March 1, 1989, use of the copyright
	notice is optional. Before March 1, 1989, the use of the notice was
	mandatory on all published works. Omitting the notice on any work first
	published from January 1, 1978, to February 28, 1989, could have
	resulted in the loss of copyright protection if corrective steps were
	not taken within a certain amount of time. Works published before
	January 1, 1978, are governed by the 1909 Copyright Act. Under that
	law, if a work was published under the copyright owner's authority
	without a proper notice of copyright, all copyright protection for that
	work was permanently lost in the United States.</div>
